# ðŸ’° Trading algorithms
Hello thereðŸ‘‹ It's a minimalistic repository with machine learning and deep learning algorithms for stock market trading. Please, see `examples` directory with code snippets.
## Installation
- Clone the repo and cd into it:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Khaymon/trading-algorithms.git
cd trading-algorithms
```
- Install required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Downloading the data
### Stock market data
Data is loaded by `yahoo-finance` module. You can use `yf_download_data.py` for it.
```bash
python yf_download_data.py
```

## Entities
### Containers
Containers are classes, which collect some data in it. Main class for stocks market data is `StocksData`. `StocksTarget` class is used to save a target for a concrete task.

### Features
Features are some functions from market data. Important thing to understand before constructing your own `Feature` is that function shouldn't look forward in time. `FeaturesList` is used to aggregate many of `Features` in one place.


### Target functions
`TargetFunction` is a class, which defines a function creating a target data. It can be either regression or classification target.


### Model preprocessors
Model preprocessors takes stocks data and target to prepare it for being placed in a model.


### Models
Of course, there are models, which take the input produced by specific model preprocessor and make predictions.
